# Easy gRPC Documentation with Node.js Examples (Work in Progress)

This repository aims to provide clear and concise documentation for gRPC using practical Node.js examples. I'm focusing on making gRPC accessible to beginners by illustrating core concepts with easy-to-understand code.

**Current Status:**

* **gRPC Method Examples:** Complete! You'll find examples covering:
    * Unary RPCs
    * Server-side Streaming RPCs
    * Client-side Streaming RPCs
    * Bidirectional Streaming RPCs
* **Metadata:** Complete! You'll find examples covering gRPC metadata:
    * Unary metadata
    * Server-side metadata
    * client-stream metadata
    * Duplex-stream metadata

* **Retry:** Complete! You'll find examples covering gRPC retry config:
    * How to implement service config on client side

* **Keepalive:** Complete! You'll find examples covering gRPC keepalive config:
     * keepalive configurations for server and client      

* **Interceptor:** In progress! 

**What to Expect:**

* Simple and well-commented Node.js code.
* Step-by-step explanations of gRPC concepts.
* Practical examples that you can run and modify.

**Future Updates:**

* Comprehensive documentation for gRPC metadata.
* Error handling and best practices.
* Advanced gRPC features (e.g., deadlines, interceptors).
* improved documentation on setting up your environment.
